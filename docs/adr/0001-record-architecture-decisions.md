# 0001: Record architecture decisions

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-09-18

## Context
We want a lightweight, versioned way to capture significant architectural decisions and their rationale.

## Decision
Adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in `docs/adr/`, one file per decision using the local template (`docs/adr/template.md`).

## Consequences
- Improves shared understanding and historical context.
- Adds minimal process overhead to record major decisions.
